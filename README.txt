Project Overview

This project implements a fully offline, CPU-only, and reproducible sentiment analysis system using the IMDb Movie Review Dataset.
Instead of deep learning frameworks, this project uses a classical NLP pipeline:

TF-IDF vectorization

Logistic Regression classifier

The goal is to classify movie reviews as Positive or Negative using a lightweight, interpretable, and resource-efficient model.

This project is designed to meet the requirements of the Deep Learning Course Project Report.
